# whos-that-pokemon APP

A cute lil' React Native app that presents a series of questions to help identify a pokemon. 

Initially built to talk directly to [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), this app now talks to the `Who's That Pokémon API` which can be found in the [api/](../api/) folder of the root project.

## Running the app on your device 

To run the app locally: install the [Expo Go app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) on your physical device. Then run
```bash
yarn start
```
and scan the QR code that pops up in the terminal.
