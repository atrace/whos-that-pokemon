# whos-that-pokemon APP

A cute lil' React Native app that presents a series of questions to help identify a pokemon. 

Initially built to talk directly to [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), this app now talks to the `Who's That Pokémon API` which can be found in the [api/](../api/) folder of the root project.

## Running the app on your device 

This app talks to a local version of the lil pokemon API, so you will need to first link up and run this for the app to work. See the top-level [README](../README.md) for instructions on how to do this.
